				Anti-dumping duty imposed on Ofloxacin import from China# 
#
India has imposed anti-dumping duty on import of Chinese pharma product, used in treatment of certain infections, to protect domestic producers from below-cost shipments.# 
#
The duty on import of 'Ofloxacin' from China will be in the range of USD 2.58 to USD 9.48 per kilogram for three years, said a notification issued by the revenue department in the finance ministry. #
#
The levy has been slapped following the recommendations of the Directorate General of Anti-Dumping and Allied Duties (DGAD).# 
#
Arti Drugs had approached the DGAD for initiation of anti-dumping investigation and imposition of the duty concerning imports of Ofloxacin, originating in or exported from China.# 
#
After a probe into the imports, the Authority concluded that the product has been exported to India from China below its normal value, 'resulting in dumping'. #
#
'The domestic industry has suffered material injury due to dumping of the product...,' the DGAD said while recommending the levy.# 
#
Ofloxacin is used to treat certain infections including bronchitis, pneumonia and infections of the skin, bladder, urinary tract, reproductive organs, and prostate (a male reproductive gland).# 
#
Ofloxacin is in a class of antibiotics called fluoroquinolones. It works by killing bacteria that cause infections. #
#
Countries carry out anti-dumping probe to determine whether their domestic industries have been hurt because of a surge in imports which are below the cost of producing them.#
#
As a counter measure, they impose duties under the multilateral regime of WTO. #
#
The duty is aimed at ensuring fair trading practises and creating a level-playing field for domestic producers with regard to foreign producers and exporters. #
