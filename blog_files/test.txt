commodities entering into trading list, India ms better placed compared to other
contemporary underdeveloped countries. But that must not be viewed as an indicator of
prosperity. Above all, her pattern of tlade ms deﬁnitely diﬁerent from those of other
underdeveloped countries

India’s composition of trade (Le., pattern of imports and exports) before 1813 included
manufactured goods as well as primary articles in export list and metals and luxury products
