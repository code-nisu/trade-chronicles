						Foreign Trade of India#
#
What are the trade targets for India as envisaged in FTP, 2015 to 2020? Which nations are the major trading partners of India? What are the 
challenges of India in the foreign trade? How is trade very important to India now? What factors influence the Trade Policy of India?#

What factors influence the Foreign Policy of India?#
#
  =>India’s key diplomatic engagements, at bilateral, plurilateral or even multilateral levels, are defined by such targets.#
  =>There are many ways to judge the relationship between two countries, including cultural exchanges, defence cooperation, people-to-people interaction 
      and historical ties. But trade and investment targets set concrete milestones against which progress can be gauged.#
  =>The target-driven approach is now spreading to bilateral ties even with smaller nations: for example, India and Vietnam agreed to a bilateral trade 
      target of $15 billion, to be met by 2020.#
  =>There are delays in making policies into actions - India’s free trade agreement (FTA) with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is a 
     good example.#  
  =>India signed the FTA for goods in 2009, but the one on services and investment, arguably India’s strong point, is yet to come into force.#
  =>Now, India has done the next best thing: it has stretched out both the physical target as well the end-date to include more trading partners and to 
     purchase some more time before the targets are to be met.#
  =>During Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s first state visit to the US in September of 2015, the joint statement he issued with President Barack Obama 
     stated that two-way trade has increased five-fold since 2001 to nearly $100 billion, and that US President Obama and Prime Minister Modi committed
     to facilitate the actions necessary to increase trade another five-fold.#
#
Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) 2015-2020#
#
  =>India’s new foreign trade policy (FTP) for 2015-20 has set a $900 billion goods and services export target. It is almost double the $465.9 billion 
     achieved during 2013-14.#
  =>This is the policy statement: “A vision is best achieved through measurable targets.”#
  =>Marking a shift in its approach towards foreign trade policy, the government sought to rope in states and Union Territories in the process of 
    international trade while setting an export target of $900 billion by FY20.#
  =>In the foreign trade policy (FTP) 2015-2020, the commerce ministry provided for a slew of incentives for exporters and special economic zones while 
     doing away with the existing incentive schemes and introducing two schemes — Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) and Services Exports
     from India Scheme (SEIS) — for goods and services.#
  =>The FTP 2015-2020 will include the initiatives  'Make in India', 'Digital India' and ‘Skill India’ announced by the government earlier. The aim is to improve
     doing business environment and simplifying trade transactions in wake of trade facilitation agreement of the World Trade Organization.#
  =>The policy comes amid a moderation in global demand and the resultant dip in India’s exports.#
  =>For the first time, exports by e-commerce firms will be provided incentives while under the MEIS.#
  =>The government will focus on branding India’s products for which campaigns would be started soon in sectors including pharma and engineering.#
  =>Traditional exports like handloom alongside yoga in services would also be promoted.#
  =>The new policy will be reviewed after two-and-a-half years and not annually as was the practice earlier.# 
  =>Further, apart from the existing Board of Trade, a Council for Trade Development and Promotion will be set up comprising representatives from 
     states and Union Territories.#
  =>The areas under the ambit of FTP 2015-2020 are focus product scheme, market-linked focus product scheme, focus market scheme, agri 
     infrastructure incentive scrip and Vishesh Krishi Gram Udyog Yojana.#
#
Questions to be answered for clarity of purpose in FTP 2015-2020#
#
=>Given the hostile and unpredictable climate in the World Trade, the next logical questions are:#  
	-How are targets fixed? #
	-What is the strategy for meeting them?# 
	-Who should set and announce targets—the commerce ministry or the external affairs ministry? #
	-The FTP doesn't mention how Make in India or Digital India or even the smart cities policy can be integrated with the FTP to deliver 
                  higher exports of both goods and services. That remains the biggest challenge for India’s trade regime.#
	-The answers are not available yet...#

The Challenges in making the FTP 2015-2020 real#
#
  =>Indian exports are imports for other countries. Exports are not favours or acts of charity but they are either necessities or because they come at 
     cheaper prices and better quality than same products at home.#
  =>India is not a global producer of necessities. It does not have ample resources of oil, gas, minerals and nuclear material. Nor does it have as broad a 
     manufacturing base producing as cheap and varied items as China.# 
  =>The problem is what India tries to do in case of its trade is also done by the other nations and India is not very good at this game.#
#
Textiles# 
#
  =>As far as textiles are concerned, India no longer has the advantage in garments. #
  =>Vietnam, Bangladesh, Cambodia and Nepal, just to mention the neighbouring countries, cut, stitch and sew fabric faster and cheaper than India. #
  =>India’s only major hope in textiles now is as supplier of raw cotton. #
#
Gems and Jewellery #
#
  =>Gems and jewellery lost luster all over the world. #
  =>Except the Chinese and Indians, the rest of the world, particularly the West, is not fascinated by jewellery made of yellow gold.# 
  =>In Diamonds, India is still the largest diamond-processing centre in the world. But poor business conditions are driving out processors to other facilities
   like the Gemopolis export zone in Bangkok.#
#
Services#
# 
  =>Ireland, the Philippines and even Bangladesh, are speaking better English and working longer for providing outsourcing services. So, again competition.#
  =>While the non-English speaking world is desperately learning English to stay relevant, India is learning it lesser and does not mind giving up its BPO 
   advantages. #
  =>In services like nursing and basic education, India is unable to match the certification requirements of most countries.#  
  =>Given its image as an unsafe destination and lack of budget travel facilities, ‘Incredible India’ might not be able to lure tourists despite visa-on-arrivals.#
#
Make in India# 
#
  =>Is Make-in-India aimed for Indians, or the rest of the world?# 
  =>Indian consumers might be denied access to imports and forced to buy substandard products. The rest of the world cannot be.#
#
WTO and President Trump# 
  =>The World Trade Organization’s (WTO) was created in 1995 under then US president Bill Clinton. #
  =>These are vastly different times and Donald Trump is a very different president. #
  =>His administration has asked the US trade representative’s office to find ways to circumvent the WTO’s dispute system. #
  =>Central to Trump’s vision of making America great again is the suspicion that the international order is rigged against it. #
  =>All this put aside, the US will continue to dictate the international trade agenda. This places India in a difficult position on multiple levels. #
  =>The US is India’s largest single-country trading partner by some distance. #
  =>India has traded more with the rest of the world as a percentage of gross domestic product than China since 2011—and both countries, along with 
     much of the developing world, have benefited immensely from the lowering of trade barriers and the rule-based trade order that the WTO embodies.#
  =>The US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order seeking a comprehensive review of the massive trade deficit totaling more than USD 
     500 billion per annum with 16 countries, including China and India. #
  =>Now, New Delhi must undertake several reforms. A forward-looking trade policy must accompany the rationalization of the tariff structure. New 
     Delhi’s foreign trade policy, 2015-20 doesn’t go far enough in this regard.  #
  =>Today's environment calls for a trade policy that helps exporters meet international standards while reducing the cost of compliance. #
  =>In Washington, Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke of the benefits of free trade. He is unlikely to find the new administration as receptive to those 
     principles.#
